# Deep learning based Retinal Vessel Segmentation for Diabetic Retinopathy Study 

I did the corresponding project for the course Medical Image Analysis (16-725) that I took in Spring'19 at Carnegie Mellon University, Robotics Institute. 
I have used state of the art biomedical image segmentation architectures: U-Net and SegNet. 
The ReadMe.txt file and my report 16725_Report.pdf can walk you through my project steps
