** **Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation for Diabetic Retinopathy study** **

Dataset Used: DRIVE dataset: https://www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE/
I have implemented both U-net and SegNet architectures for the project and compared the results. Please go through the 16725_Report.pdf and ReadMe.txt file, that can help walk you through my code step by step. 
I used Keras for Deep learning part and used Simple ITK for viewing the images and doing initial preprocessing.
